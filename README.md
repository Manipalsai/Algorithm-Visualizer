# Algorithm Visualizer

A comprehensive full-stack application for visualizing various data structures and algorithms. This project was built to provide an interactive and educational tool for understanding core computer science concepts.

## Live Demo

## ‚ú® Features

- **Sorting Algorithms:** Visualize the step-by-step process of Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Quick, Merge, and Heap sort.
- **Searching Algorithms:** Watch Linear and Binary search in action to see their differences in efficiency.
- **Graph Traversal:** Explore graph structures with Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS).
- **Pathfinding:** See Dijkstra's and A* algorithms find the shortest path in a weighted graph.
- **Data Structures:** Interact with a Binary Search Tree and visualize a Singly and Doubly Linked List.
- **Dynamic UI:** Real-time speed control, custom data input, and a descriptive explanation for each step.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

**Frontend:**
- **React.js:** The core library for building the user interface.
- **HTML/CSS/SVG:** For structure, styling, and dynamic visualizations.

**Backend:**
- **Node.js:** The server-side environment.
- **Express.js:** The framework for building the API (ready for future features like user authentication).
- **PriorityQueue.js:** A dependency for implementing Dijkstra's and A* search.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Manipalsai/Algorithm-Visualizer.git](https://github.com/Manipalsai/Algorithm-Visualizer.git)
    cd Algorithm-Visualizer
    ```
2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
